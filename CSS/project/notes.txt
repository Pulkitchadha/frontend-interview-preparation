Top to bottom.

A7 Combinators are used to make any element unique from other.By using combination
of selectors, element selctor or class. Also, increases Specificity.
Any two selector can be used.

Q8 Types of combinators.
A8

1. Adjacent (+)
h2 + p {
    color : red;
}

a) Parent shud be same.
b) Add red color to all the p elements that are Adjacent to h2 or comes after h2.

* Box model and its part

Content - Element.
padding - Internal spacing.
border - Line btw internal & ext spacing.
margin - External spacing.


* Margin collapsing - Overlapping of margins with multiple elments.Element having bigger margin wins.

*  Block level elements (Like div, section) takes full width unlike inline elments like <a>, <button>

* display property has 4 values:
 => block = takes all available horizontal space or width. eg - div, section, nav, p, h1.
 => inline  = take the space they require to fit their content. eg - span, a, img.
 => none = hide the element.
 => inline-block =

 * Diff btw display: none, visiblity : hidden
