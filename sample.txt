// problem name

1. Understand the problem:
* Write the problem in your words. = Check 2 array has same value and frequency.
* What are the inputs ? = 2 inputs - arr1 & arr2.
* What are the outputs ? = Boolean, True if same and false if not same.
* Can we determine the outputs from the input ? = yes, we can determine.
* Add comments for imp parts.

2. Explore concrete examples:
* Start with a simple example.
* Complex examples.
* Example with empty inputs.
* Examples with invalid inputs.

3. Break it down:
* Write the Pseudocode of the program.Don't start writing the code OR we can say write down the steps you need to take.

4. Solve or simplify:
* Find the core difficulty in your program.
* Temporarily ignore that difficulty.
* Write a simplified solution.
* Incorporate that difficulty

5. Look back and refactor:
* Check the result or output.
* Can you understand it at a glance ?
* Can you use the method or solution for some other problem.
* Can you improve the performance of the solution ?
* Think about other solutions to the problem.
* Check how other people solved this problem.

Methods to solve problems:
* Frequeny counter - check duplicacy, check anagam.
* Multi pointer = array shud be sorted.
* sliding window.
* Divide n conquer.= aray shud be sorted.
